    ANSWER: {
        description: "Direct yes/no guidance with explanation",
        examples: {
            positive: `"YES — The Sun illuminates your path with absolute certainty. This is not merely agreement but cosmic celebration of your intended direction. I see success manifesting within 21 days, bringing more than you dared imagine. The universe has already begun moving pieces into place. Watch for signs in threes — three confirmations arrive before the week ends.

The child on the white horse in this card represents your innocent faith being rewarded. You asked with pure intention, and the cosmos responds with equal purity. The sunflowers turning toward light show how opportunities will now turn toward you. There's a wall in the card — yes, there was a barrier, but notice how the child has already passed beyond it. You've already done the hard work; now comes the harvest.

I see specifically: a communication arrives by Thursday, money flows more freely after the 15th, and someone who doubted you will witness your vindication. The number 19 holds significance — perhaps a date, an amount, or an address. The sun's 21 rays suggest three weeks of building brightness. Your yes isn't just permission; it's an enthusiastic cosmic endorsement.

Trust what feels warm. Follow what makes you laugh. The Sun promises that your joy itself becomes the path. When you doubt, remember this reading arrived when you needed certainty most. That itself is your first of three signs."`,
            
            negative: `"NO — The Tower speaks clearly: this path leads to necessary destruction, but not the kind you seek. What appears as opportunity conceals a profound disruption. The universe blocks this door to redirect you toward something greater arriving in autumn. Your disappointment will transform to relief by the winter solstice.

Lightning strikes the crown of false achievement in this card — see how the figures fall but don't die? They're being liberated from a prison disguised as palace. Your 'no' is protection from catastrophe you cannot yet see. If you force this door open, the collapse affects not just you but innocents around you. The number 16 suggests sixteen weeks until you understand why this rejection was mercy.

I'm seeing specifically: legal complications hide in the fine print, someone involved carries hidden debt (financial or karmic), and the foundation of this opportunity rests on someone else's deception. By November, truth emerges that makes you grateful for this divine intervention. The Tower's lightning becomes your illumination — sudden, shocking, but ultimately liberating.

What to do instead: Clear your debts (emotional and literal) by October. Strengthen your foundation. Build on truth rather than assumption. The real opportunity approaches from the East — literally or symbolically — after you've released attachment to this particular path. Your greater yes requires this present no."`,
            
            maybe: `"MAYBE — The Hanged Man suspends judgment, for timing is everything. The answer shifts like smoke because the question itself must transform. By the next new moon, circumstances will clarify dramatically. What you ask today, you may not want tomorrow. Wait. Watch. The true question emerges in 12 days.

See how the Hanged Man dangles by choice, not punishment? His peaceful face reveals secret knowledge: sometimes suspension is strategy. Your question exists in quantum state — both yes and no simultaneously until a specific variable resolves. I see this variable connected to another person's decision, arriving between the 12th and 15th of next month.

The tree from which he hangs has deep roots and green leaves — this situation has both history and future, but the present requires absolute stillness. You're asking if you should leap, but you're currently upside down. When you right yourself (and you will, suddenly, triggered by unexpected news), the answer becomes obvious. The halo around his head suggests enlightenment through patience.

Here's what's actually happening: The universe is rearranging massive pieces behind scenes you cannot access. Your maybe protects you from committing before the full picture reveals itself. Someone significant hasn't made their move yet. A hidden factor (likely financial or legal) must surface. The crossing of paths that makes this decision clear happens at a gathering you'll attend reluctantly. Until then, float. Your suspension is not stagnation but sacred pause."`

    // LOVE • MONEY • LIFE FLOW
    LOVE: {
        description: "Romance, relationships, emotional connections",
        examples: {
            general: `"The Three of Cups in your love sector celebrates connections multiplying. I see a gathering — perhaps a wedding, reunion, or celebration — becoming the catalyst for romantic expansion. Someone from your wider circle holds deeper feelings than you realize. By month's end, friendship transforms into something more electric. The universe weaves love through community.

The three women raising their cups in this card show how your romantic life cannot be separated from your soul family. Love arrives through laughter, through shared celebration, through the friend who brings a friend who becomes everything. I'm seeing specifically: an event involving music or art, someone wearing blue who catches your attention, and a conversation about travel that becomes an invitation to journey together.

The overflow from these chalices suggests abundance — you're entering a phase where multiple romantic opportunities present themselves. This isn't about choosing immediately but about allowing yourself to be chosen. The fruits scattered at their feet represent harvest from seeds planted in friendship. Someone you've known for at least three months sees you with new eyes after witnessing you in your element.

By the next full moon, clarity arrives through a group message or social media interaction that sparks private conversation. The number 3 repeats — third date reveals truth, three weeks until declaration, three people instrumental in this connection. Trust the pathway that includes others; solitary hunting fails now. Love arrives laughing, probably slightly drunk on life, definitely through your existing connections expanding unexpectedly."`,
            
            challenging: `"The Five of Swords in love warns of battles where victory means loss. You or your beloved wage war with shadows, defending against wounds already healed. This mental conflict peaks within two weeks. Choose vulnerability over being right. The argument you're planning will cost more than the silence you're avoiding.

Look at the figure collecting swords while others walk away defeated — this is the hollow victory awaiting if you persist in being right rather than being loving. The storm clouds gathering in the card's background show the emotional weather coming if this mental warfare continues. Your mind has become a blade that cuts both ways. Every point you score draws blood from the relationship's body.

I see specifically: old resentments from 3-5 years ago being weaponized, someone's family becoming involved unhelpfully, and words spoken in anger that cannot be retrieved. The two figures walking away represent the parts of both your souls that retreat when the ego advances with swords drawn. This conflict originates not in the present but in childhood patterns — someone feels unheard because they were unheard then.

The path through: Drop your sword first. Literally or symbolically, put down your weapon by the 10th. Speak to the wound beneath the anger. The phrase 'I'm scared of losing you' changes everything. The jagged mountains in the distance represent the rough terrain you'll cross if this battle continues. Choose the peace that feels like losing but wins everything worth keeping. The number 5 suggests five days of conscious disarmament needed."`,
            
            transformative: `"Death in your love position announces the absolute ending that becomes beginning. A relationship paradigm dies completely — not necessarily a person leaving, but a way of loving that no longer serves. By the spring equinox, you'll understand why this had to burn. Phoenix love rises from these ashes.

The skeleton rides a white horse, bringing transformation, not tragedy. See the sun rising between the two towers in the distance? That's your new love life being born as the old one dies. The king lies dead (old patriarchal patterns), the child and woman kneel (innocence and emotion accepting change), but the priest stands, blessing this transition. Every figure represents aspects of how you've loved before, now transforming.

What dies specifically: codependency disguised as devotion, anxiety disguised as passion, control disguised as care. The relationship structure you've known — whether with a specific person or as a pattern — cannot continue. If partnered, you'll either separate or revolutionize your connection so completely that friends won't recognize your dynamic. If single, your entire approach to love transforms. The armor Death wears shows this isn't vulnerable change but protected transformation.

I'm seeing: a conversation that changes everything near the 13th, someone's relocation or job change that catalyzes transformation, and the discovery of a truth that's been hidden for exactly one year. The white rose on Death's flag promises purity after purging. What feels like ending is actually finally beginning. The river in the card flows toward the sunrise — follow the current even when it carries you through darkness. By spring, you'll laugh at who you used to be in love."`

    MONEY: {
        description: "Finances, career, material resources",
        examples: {
            general: `"The Nine of Pentacles in your money sector manifests abundance through patience rewarded. A project you've nurtured reaches harvest between now and autumn. I see a specific figure — $9,000 or multiples of nine — appearing significantly. Your self-reliance becomes your fortune. Independence brings wealth that dependence never could."`,
            
            challenging: `"The Five of Pentacles in money reveals temporary exile from abundance. This financial winter lasts exactly one season more. You're walking past help you cannot see — an opportunity disguised as beneath you waits at your doorstep. Swallow pride by the full moon. Ask for what you need. Resources hide in humility."`,
            
            transformative: `"The Wheel of Fortune spins your financial axis completely. What was up goes down, what was down rises. A sudden reversal — lottery, inheritance, unexpected offer — arrives within 10 weeks. Prepare for vertigo as your material world reorganizes. This isn't luck; it's karma collecting its debts."`
        }
    },

    LIFE: {
        description: "Overall life path, spiritual journey, major themes",
        examples: {
            general: `"The Star in your life position promises healing rains after wildfire. You've survived your dark night of the soul — now comes the slow, sacred restoration. Seven months of gradual rebuilding begin now. Dreams become prophetic. Water features prominently. A wish made in despair finds unexpected answer."`,
            
            challenging: `"The Devil in life position reveals the chains you've decorated as jewelry. An addiction — not necessarily substance, perhaps to a person, pattern, or belief — controls more than you admit. This bondage breaks only when you see it fully. The key has always been in your hand. Liberation costs comfort."`,
            
            transformative: `"The World in your life position completes a cycle so profound you'll divide existence into 'before' and 'after.' A 9-year journey concludes within three months. Every thread weaves into pattern. Every loss reveals its purpose. You're graduating from an invisible university. The diploma arrives as profound peace."`
        }
    },

    // PAST • PRESENT • FUTURE FLOW
    PAST: {
        description: "Foundation, history, what brought you here",
        examples: {
            general: `"The Six of Cups in your past reveals childhood's golden thread still weaving through today. Someone from before — a childhood friend, first love, or family member — planted seeds now flowering. That innocence you thought lost merely went underground, protecting itself until safe to bloom. The past isn't finished with its gifts."`,
            
            challenging: `"The Ten of Swords in your past marks the betrayal that became your teaching. That ending felt like death because it was — the death of who you were before wisdom arrived through wounds. This devastation, though years old, still shapes your caution. But notice: you survived your worst fear. You're already proof of resurrection."`,
            
            transformative: `"The Fool in your past shows the leap that created everything. There was a moment you chose courage over certainty, and though the path meandered strangely, that original faith was correct. You're still living the consequence of that beautiful risk. The innocence that seemed naive was actually prophecy."`
        }
    },

    PRESENT: {
        description: "Current state, what's happening now",
        examples: {
            general: `"The Two of Pentacles in your present captures your juggling act perfectly. You balance opposing forces with dancer's grace, though exhaustion builds. This performance peaks within two weeks — then one ball must drop so you can catch what matters. The universe applauds your skill but prepares simpler rhythm."`,
            
            challenging: `"The Seven of Swords in your present reveals the secret you're keeping or the one kept from you. Deception weaves through current circumstances — not maliciously, but from fear of consequence. Truth emerges before month's end. Better to confess than be discovered. Honesty hurts less than exposure."`,
            
            transformative: `"The Tower in your present strikes lightning through your life's structure. What falls was built on false foundation. This isn't punishment but liberation — though it feels like catastrophe. In 16 days, you'll see the prison this tower actually was. Thank the lightning when dust settles."`
        }
    },

    FUTURE: {
        description: "What's coming, trajectory, outcome",
        examples: {
            general: `"The Ace of Wands in your future ignites new creative fire within one lunar cycle. An opportunity arrives like lightning — sudden, electric, demanding immediate action. This isn't gentle growth but explosive beginning. Prepare for inspiration so intense it disrupts sleep. Your creative pregnancy begins at the next new moon."`,
            
            challenging: `"The Four of Cups in your future warns of divine offerings refused from boredom. Success brings unexpected emptiness. What you achieve feels hollow because you're measuring by outdated values. The universe prepares a gift you'll almost reject from apathy. Wake up before it withdraws. Gratitude becomes urgent medicine."`,
            
            transformative: `"Judgement in your future sounds the trumpet of absolute awakening. A calling so clear it shatters all doubt arrives within one season. This isn't choice but destiny announcing itself. Old life becomes impossible to inhabit. You'll rise from your own grave, astonished at who you've become. Resurrection is imminent."`
        }
    },

    // ENERGY • CHALLENGE • TIMING FLOW
    ENERGY: {
        description: "Current energy to embody, vibration to match",
        examples: {
            general: `"The Queen of Wands radiates through your energy field now — magnetic, creative, fiercely independent. Channel this sovereign fire into leadership without apology. Others sense your power building and respond with either attraction or intimidation. Own your throne. The universe crowns those who crown themselves."`,
            
            challenging: `"The Eight of Swords energy surrounds you — but notice the blindfold is loose, the bonds are weak. This imprisonment is mental, maintained by thoughts you could change but don't. Your energy feels trapped because you're generating the cage. One brave thought breaks eight coward thoughts. Liberation requires only decision."`,
            
            transformative: `"The Magician energy floods your field — pure manifestation power awaits direction. You hold all four elements, all tools necessary. What you speak becomes. What you focus on multiplies. This energy peaks for exactly 8 days. Use it or lose it. The universe made you temporarily omnipotent — act accordingly."`
        }
    },

    CHALLENGE: {
        description: "Obstacle to overcome, test to pass",
        examples: {
            general: `"The Knight of Swords charges as your challenge — impulsive action threatens careful plans. Someone around you (or your own shadow) moves too fast, speaks too sharply, cuts before considering. This challenge peaks in 3 days. Slow the knight down. Speed kills more than enemies here."`,
            
            challenging: `"The Three of Swords presents heartbreak as teacher. This challenge isn't avoiding pain but moving through it cleanly. Grief delayed becomes poison. The conversation you're avoiding, the tears you're suppressing, the ending you're denying — face it within one week or it faces you within one month, doubled in intensity."`,
            
            transformative: `"The Hermit challenges you to withdraw when everything screams 'engage!' Solitude becomes your assignment. Others will call you selfish, absent, changed. Yes. You are changing. This cave time lasts 9 weeks. What you find in darkness becomes your light forever. Society's permission was never required."`
        }
    },

    TIMING: {
        description: "When things will happen, cosmic schedule",
        examples: {
            general: `"The Eight of Wands promises swift movement within 8 days. What felt stuck suddenly flies. Messages arrive in clusters. Travel spontaneously manifests. Everything accelerates. Prepare for time compression — a month of change packed into a week. The universe breaks the speed limit for you."`,
            
            challenging: `"The Four of Swords enforces divine pause for exactly 4 weeks. Nothing moves because nothing should. This isn't delay but necessary restoration. Fighting this timing creates exhaustion without progress. Rest isn't optional. The universe prescribes stillness as medicine. Motion returns at the full moon."`,
            
            transformative: `"The Wheel of Fortune reveals three distinct timing waves: immediate (within 10 days), medium (within 10 weeks), and complete (within 10 months). Each turn of the wheel brings reversal — what's down goes up, what's up goes down. Mark these intervals. Destiny operates on schedule."`
