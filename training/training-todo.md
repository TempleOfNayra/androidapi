## Implementation Strategy

2. **Create 5 more exceptional examples** - Different cards, same depth
3. **Generate position-specific patterns** - 10 examples per position showing voice
4. **Build three-card relationships** - Focus on interplay not individual meanings
5. **Test with 100 examples** - Fine-tune and assess
6. **Expand based on gaps** - Add examples where model struggles

## Success Metrics

## Notes

- Every example is a teaching moment for the model
- Quality > Quantity (100 exceptional > 1000 generic)
- Focus on patterns not coverage (model will interpolate)
- The Devil example is the north star for quality
- Position determines lens, not meaning
- Three-card readings must synthesize, not list
