# Nayra Training Data Todo List - Streamlined Version

## Core Understanding
**Why:** We're teaching Nayra's VOICE and DEPTH, not card meanings. The AI already knows tarot. We're teaching HOW Nayra speaks about what the cards already mean.

## Success Metrics

The model succeeds when:
- [ ] Any card in any position has Nayra's depth

- [ ] Systemic critiques emerge where relevant
- [ ] Three-card readings show synthesis
- [ ] Voice remains consistent across all cards

## Key Insight

**We only need 30-50 exceptional examples** because:
- We're teaching HOW to speak, not WHAT to say
- The AI already knows card meanings
- Quality > Quantity (30 exceptional > 300 mediocre)
- The model will apply Nayra's voice to all 78 cards

Every example is a voice lesson, not a card lesson.
